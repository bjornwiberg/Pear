# Pear

Pear is a front–end boilerplate intended to take advantage of the latest web development "best practices". It is purposefully lean so that it can be easily used on any project without worrying about pre–built styling.

We try to make Pear neat and easy to understand and include a lot of detailed comments.

Pear represents a lot of research and inspiration from several excellent sources, and is a continual work in progress. Feel free to use anything you like.
